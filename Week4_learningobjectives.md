## Simulating random values

#### Normal functions
There are 4 types of functions for every kind of random value creation command available in R. 
These functions are all named with the *type of function* + *value type* e.g rnorm (where, r denotes a function that creates a vector of cases)
* **"r"** functions: create a vector with the specified number of cases of random value from a normal distribution, given a set mean and standard deviation. 
* **"p"** functions: create a vector of cumulative probability values;
* **"q"** functions: returns the quantile values for the specified probabilities;
* **"d"** functions: returns the density distribution for a set of values.
